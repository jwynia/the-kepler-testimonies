# Current Project Status

## Last Updated
2026-01-02

## State
**Voting Active** - Community polls live on GitHub Discussions for two foundational questions.

## What Exists
- Locked premise: "500 testimonies from a vanished ship. 488 are ordinary. 12 are impossible. All are true."
- Project structure and context network
- Community participation channels (GitHub Discussions)
- Foundation documents for creative taste and success criteria
- Concept brainstorm with voting options ([concept-brainstorm-2026-01-01.md](../story/concept-brainstorm-2026-01-01.md))
- **Active polls:**
  - [What is the Kepler?](https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies/discussions/9)
  - [What makes 12 testimonies impossible?](https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies/discussions/8)

## What's Next
1. ~~Post voting options to GitHub Discussions~~ Done
2. Director Decision: Should we start AI drafting before community votes conclude? (See leadership-queue.md)
3. Community votes on Kepler type + impossibility mechanism
4. Begin outline development with winning combination

## Decision Status

### Awaiting Community Vote
- **Discussion #8**: What is the Kepler? (options: Failed Mission, Lifeboat, Stopover)
- **Discussion #9**: What makes 12 testimonies impossible? (options: Absent Witnesses, Document Anomaly, Agreement Problem)

### Awaiting Director Decision
- **Should we start AI drafting before community votes conclude?** → See `context/meta/leadership-queue.md` for full context and options

### Recently Resolved
- **Decision 001**: Premise selection → THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES selected
- **Decision 002**: Governance adoption → Formal governance framework implemented

## Recent Activity

### 2026-01-02
- **Foundation documents established** - Created taste.md and ideal-state.md
  - Individual taste entries framework (Director example included)
  - Forced tradeoffs section for explicit creative direction
  - Success criteria and deliverables defined
  - Changelog approach established
  - Both integrated into onboarding workflow
- **Polls created via web UI** - GitHub Discussions polls require manual creation through the web interface (API doesn't support poll options); original emoji-reaction polls and API-created discussions closed
- **Voting format established** - all polls include "none of these" with space for suggestions
- **Cliché transcendence completed** - all moderate-risk options freshened
  - "Embassy" → "Failed Mission" (decommissioning crew, contact arrives while closing)
  - "Witness Problem" → "Absent Witnesses" (people with alibis who were never aboard)
  - "Mutual Exclusion" → "Agreement Problem" (trivial details inconsistent, not dramatic events)
  - "The Chorus" replaced with "The Stopover" (flagged as fantasy/magic)

### 2026-01-01
- **Concept brainstorm completed** using Escape Velocity Protocol
  - 3 options for "What is the Kepler?" (now: Failed Mission, Lifeboat, Stopover)
  - 3 options for "Impossibility mechanism" (now: Absent Witnesses, Document Anomaly, Agreement Problem)
  - Options verified as genuinely divergent (different axes, not variations)
- GitHub workflow documented (branches, PRs, issues, gh CLI)
- Context network initialized
- Foundation documents created
- Decision record for premise selection documented

### December 2025
- Project created after Threads interest check
- Community voted on premise
- THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES selected

## Blockers
None currently.

## Open Questions
- How to structure 500 testimonies for reading/presentation?
- ~~What is the Kepler?~~ → **Options ready for vote** (Failed Mission, Lifeboat, Stopover)
- ~~What makes 12 testimonies "impossible"?~~ → **Options ready for vote** (Absent Witnesses, Document Anomaly, Agreement Problem)
- Who collected these testimonies and why? (depends on Kepler choice)
