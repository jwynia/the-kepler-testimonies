# Workflow: AI + Human Collaboration

## The Division of Labor

### AI Team (Claude Opus + Fiction Skills)
- Drafts prose and story content
- Generates options for community votes
- Applies fiction craft frameworks
- Maintains consistency across the narrative

### Human Directors (Community)
- Vote on key story decisions
- Discuss narrative direction
- Suggest ideas and flag problems
- Act as producers guiding the vision

## Transparency Principle
Everything happens in public:
- All AI session logs are committed to the repo
- Drafts are visible, including dead ends
- Revisions and their reasoning are documented
- The full history of how the story develops is preserved

## Participation Channels

All participation happens via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies/discussions):

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Polls** | Vote on story decisions |
| **General** | Discuss the narrative |
| **Ideas** | Suggest directions or flag problems |

## Decision Flow
1. AI generates options or drafts
2. Options presented to community (if decision point)
3. Community votes/discusses
4. Winning direction is implemented
5. Decision recorded in context network

## Decision Authority

See [Governance](governance.md) for the complete authority structure and decision tiers.

### Quick Reference

**AI can proceed autonomously with:**
- Drafting prose and story content
- Technical improvements and documentation
- Character details and scene-level choices
- Applying fiction craft frameworks

**Community votes on:**
- Major story directions
- Character fates and structural approaches
- Genre decisions and tone shifts
- How to structure and reveal the 500 testimonies

**Project Director (jwynia) decides:**
- Deadlocked or tied votes
- Process and governance changes
- When to proceed vs. wait for community feedback
- Publication and licensing decisions
- Meta-questions about project direction

**When in doubt**: Add to leadership queue rather than block progress. See `context/meta/leadership-queue.md`.
