# Plan: Structured Taste Evaluation Criteria

## Context

PR #13 proposes:
- `context/foundation/taste.md` - Individual creative preferences (narrative style)
- `context/foundation/ideal-state.md` - Success criteria and changelog

**The Gap**: These documents capture preferences but lack the structured, evaluable format that existing skills use (story-sense states, genre-conventions requirements, revision checklists).

## Goal

Transform narrative taste preferences into **structured evaluation criteria** that:
1. Can be diagnosed (symptoms → state → intervention)
2. Can be evaluated objectively (checklists, requirements)
3. Integrate with existing fiction skills
4. Guide Tier 1 autonomous drafting decisions

## Approach: Structured Taste Framework

### 1. Extract Evaluation Dimensions from Jon's Taste Entry

From the existing narrative preferences, derive evaluable dimensions:

| Preference | Dimension | Evaluable Criteria |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| "Competent people facing real constraints" | **Competence vs. Bumbling** | Characters solve problems methodically; failures come from constraints not stupidity |
| "Actual machinations of power" | **Institutional Realism** | Power flows through incentives/info/constraints, not cartoon corruption |
| "Wit as character voice" | **Voice-Integrated Humor** | Wit comes from character, not narrator commentary |
| "Grounded worldbuilding" | **Worldbuilding Subordination** | World serves story, not reverse; details earn their place |
| "Earned impossibility" | **Impossibility Logic** | The 12 impossibilities have internal logic, not arbitrary |

### 2. Create Taste States (Modeled on story-sense)

Similar to story-sense states, create diagnosable taste states:

```
State T1: Institutional Cartoon
Symptoms: Government dumb, corporation evil, hero sees through
Fix: Show incentives, constraints, internal knowledge

State T2: Cynicism as Cleverness
Symptoms: Snark without substance, nihilism posing as insight
Fix: Ground critique in specific mechanism, show stakes

State T3: Worldbuilding Dominance
Symptoms: Story stops for exposition, setting > character
Fix: Deliver world through action, cut info dumps

State T4: Narrator Commentary
Symptoms: Wit comes from outside story, author intrudes
Fix: Embed voice in character, cut narrator jokes

State T5: Unearned Impossibility
Symptoms: Magic/mystery arbitrary, "because plot" answers
Fix: Establish internal logic, earn the reveal
```

### 3. Create Taste Checklist (Modeled on revision passes)

For each testimony draft, a taste evaluation pass:

**Institutional Realism Check**
- [ ] If authority figures appear, do they have constraints?
- [ ] If decisions go wrong, is failure mechanism clear?
- [ ] Is there an internal view (not just external critique)?

**Competence Check**
- [ ] Do characters approach problems methodically?
- [ ] Are failures from constraints, not stupidity?
- [ ] Do characters have skills appropriate to their roles?

**Voice Check**
- [ ] Does wit come from character, not narrator?
- [ ] Are voices distinct per testimony?
- [ ] Is humor situation-grounded?

**Worldbuilding Check**
- [ ] Does exposition earn its place?
- [ ] Are details delivered through action?
- [ ] Does world serve story, not reverse?

### 4. Integration with Existing Skills

| Skill | Taste Integration |
|-------|-------------------|
| story-sense | Add T1-T5 states to diagnostic tree |
| genre-conventions | Add "Kepler Mystery" requirements |
| revision | Add "Taste Pass" to six-pass sequence |
| drafting | Pre-flight checklist before testimony drafting |

## Deliverables

1. **Enhance `taste.md`** with structured evaluation section:
   - Taste States (T1-T5) with symptoms/fixes
   - Taste Checklist for drafts
   - Integration points with skills

2. **Create taste-eval tool** (optional):
   - `deno run scripts/taste-eval.ts testimony.md`
   - Pattern-match for taste violations

3. **Update `voice.md`** (when drafting begins):
   - Link taste criteria to voice decisions
   - Apply structured evaluation to sample testimonies

## Files to Modify

- `context/foundation/taste.md` (in PR #13) - Add structured section
- `context/story/craft/voice.md` - Link to taste criteria
- Optionally: `.claude/skills/story-sense/SKILL.md` - Add taste states

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Scope**: Should this enhance PR #13's taste.md, or create a separate document?
2. **Granularity**: Should taste states be project-specific or general?
3. **Integration depth**: Full skill integration or lightweight reference?
