# Naming Framework

A diagnostic framework for creating names that work—brands, products, characters, places, titles.

## Problem Statement

Names fail in predictable ways: they don't feel right, they don't fit together, they're forgettable, they send wrong signals. The difference between a name that works and one that doesn't often comes down to invisible patterns—sound, meaning, cultural resonance—that most people can sense but can't articulate.

## Core Insight: Names Operate on Multiple Layers

Every name communicates through layers that work together or against each other:

1. **Sound Layer** — How it sounds, feels in the mouth, and what sounds evoke
2. **Meaning Layer** — Denotation, connotation, metaphor, reference
3. **Cultural Layer** — What associations it triggers in specific audiences
4. **Functional Layer** — How it works in use (typing, speaking, remembering)

When layers align, names feel inevitable. When they conflict, names feel wrong even if no one can say why.

---

## The Naming States

### State N1: Name Doesn't "Feel Right"

**Symptoms:** Stakeholders reject names but can't articulate why. Names feel "off" without clear reason. Gut reactions are negative despite meeting requirements.

**Key Questions:**
- Do the sounds match the intended emotional tone?
- Is there a meaning conflict between layers?
- Does it violate cultural expectations for this category?

**Common Causes:**
- Sound-meaning mismatch (harsh sounds for gentle brand)
- Cultural layer conflict (sounds like something negative in context)
- Functional friction (hard to say, spell, or type)

**Interventions:**
- Analyze sound layer independently (see Sound Patterns below)
- Check for unintended associations
- Test pronunciation and typing flow

---

### State N2: Names Don't Belong Together

**Symptoms:** Product family feels disjointed. Character names could be from different worlds. Place names lack coherent cultural identity.

**Key Questions:**
- Is there a consistent sound palette?
- Do syllable structures match?
- Is there a unifying pattern (prefix, suffix, rhythm)?

**Common Causes:**
- No phoneme inventory defined
- Mixed linguistic origins without intent
- Ad-hoc naming without system

**Interventions:**
- Define phoneme inventory (which sounds are "in" this system)
- Establish syllable templates (CV, CVC, CVCV, etc.)
- Create naming conventions document
- Regenerate outliers to fit system

---

### State N3: Name Is Forgettable

**Symptoms:** People can't recall the name. It blends into category. No distinctive hook.

**Key Questions:**
- Is there a memorable sound pattern (alliteration, rhythm)?
- Does it have a clear meaning hook?
- Is it too similar to competitors/alternatives?

**Common Causes:**
- Too generic (follows category conventions too closely)
- No distinctive sound feature
- Meaning is abstract without concrete anchor

**Interventions:**
- Add sound distinctiveness (unusual but pronounceable combination)
- Create meaning hook (metaphor, unexpected reference)
- Test against competitors for differentiation

---

### State N4: Name Sends Wrong Signals

**Symptoms:** Audience interprets name differently than intended. Wrong category assumptions. Unintended associations.

**Key Questions:**
- What does this name sound like it should be?
- What category conventions is it following/breaking?
- Are there unfortunate associations in target markets?

**Common Causes:**
- Sound patterns associated with different category
- Cultural reference not understood by audience
- Unintended meaning in other languages/contexts

**Interventions:**
- Audit category sound conventions
- Test with target audience for associations
- Check international/cross-cultural meanings

---

### State N5: Name Doesn't Work in Practice

**Symptoms:** People misspell it. They mispronounce it. It's hard to type. Domain isn't available.

**Key Questions:**
- Is spelling intuitive from pronunciation?
- Are there common mistypings?
- Does it work in all required contexts (URL, voice search, etc.)?

**Common Causes:**
- Spelling-pronunciation mismatch
- Unusual letter combinations
- Conflicting with common words for autocorrect

**Interventions:**
- Test spelling from dictation
- Check typo patterns
- Verify domain and social handle availability
- Test voice search recognition

---

## The Four Layers

### Sound Layer

How the name sounds and what sounds communicate.

#### Sound-Meaning Connections

Certain sounds carry consistent associations across languages (sound symbolism):

| Sound Pattern | Association | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Depth sounds** (ɑ, o, u, m, n) | Depth, weight, seriousness | "Om", "profound", "doom" |
| **Light sounds** (i, e, l, s) | Speed, lightness, precision | "swift", "sleek", "elite" |
| **Power sounds** (k, t, p, x) | Strength, hardness, impact | "strike", "crack", "apex" |
| **Flow sounds** (l, r, w, vowel clusters) | Movement, continuity | "flow", "glide", "aurora" |
| **Tech sounds** (x, z, -ix, -ex) | Technical, modern, digital | "Linux", "Xerox", "codex" |

#### Phoneme Selection

Which sounds to include or exclude shapes the name's character:

**High-frequency sounds** (feel natural, trustworthy):
- Consonants: t, n, s, k, m, p, l, r
- Vowels: a, i, e, o, u

**Low-frequency sounds** (feel distinctive, exotic):
- Consonants: x, z, q, zh
- Vowels: ü, ø, æ (in English contexts)

**Principle:** Use common sounds for accessibility, rare sounds for distinctiveness. Too many rare sounds = unpronounceable.

#### Syllable Structure

Syllable patterns affect pronounceability and feel:

| Pattern | Feel | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| CV (consonant-vowel) | Open, flowing | "Sora", "Kano" |
| CVC | Solid, complete | "Mark", "Bond" |
| CVCV | Balanced, memorable | "Toyota", "Coca" |
| CVCC | Weighty, serious | "Ernst", "Kraft" |
| CCV | Dynamic, energetic | "Sprite", "Slack" |

**Principle:** Simpler syllable structures = easier pronunciation across languages.

---

### Meaning Layer

What the name denotes, connotes, and references.

#### Meaning Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Descriptive** | Says what it is | "General Motors", "Toys R Us" |
| **Metaphorical** | Implies qualities through comparison | "Amazon" (vast), "Apple" (simple, fresh) |
| **Abstract** | Coined word, meaning assigned | "Xerox", "Kodak" |
| **Founder/Place** | Named after person or location | "Ford", "Brooklyn Brewery" |
| **Acronym** | Initials of longer name | "IBM", "BMW" |
| **Portmanteau** | Blend of words | "Pinterest" (pin+interest) |

#### Meaning Layers

Names can carry multiple meaning levels:

1. **Literal** — Direct denotation
2. **Metaphorical** — What it implies about qualities
3. **Cultural** — References to shared knowledge
4. **Personal** — Individual associations

**Best names** work on multiple levels, rewarding deeper attention.

---

### Cultural Layer

What associations the name triggers in specific audiences.

#### Category Conventions

Every category has naming conventions that signal membership:

| Category | Convention | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Luxury fashion | French/Italian sounds | "Hermès", "Versace" |
| Tech startups | Dropped vowels, -ly, -ify | "Tumblr", "Spotify" |
| Law firms | Partner surnames | "Sullivan & Cromwell" |
| Pharmaceuticals | X, Z, scientific suffixes | "Xanax", "Prozac" |
| Fantasy characters | Apostrophes, unusual clusters | "Drizzt", "Kvothe" |

**Strategic choice:** Follow conventions to signal belonging, or break them to differentiate.

#### Cultural Resonance

Names carry cultural weight:
- **References** — Allusions to mythology, literature, history
- **Language origin** — Latin (authority), Greek (science), Japanese (precision)
- **Sound associations** — What this sounds like in the culture

---

### Functional Layer

How the name works in practical use.

#### Functional Tests

| Test | Question | Failure Mode |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Spelling** | Can people spell it from hearing? | Constant correction needed |
| **Pronunciation** | Can people say it from reading? | Name avoidance |
| **Typing** | Is it easy to type quickly? | Typos, frustration |
| **Searchability** | Does it return relevant results? | Lost traffic |
| **Domain** | Is .com (or relevant TLD) available? | Compromised identity |
| **Voice** | Does voice search recognize it? | Missed commands |

#### Domain Strategy

For brand names requiring web presence:

**Priority TLDs:**
1. **.com** — Still default, highest trust
2. **.io/.ai** — Acceptable for tech
3. **Country codes** — For regional brands
4. **New TLDs** — Lower recognition but increasing

**If exact .com unavailable:**
- Add word: "get[name].com", "[name]app.com"
- Spelling variant (if intuitive)
- Consider whether name is worth the limitation

## The Naming Process

### Phase 1: Requirements

Before generating names, establish:

1. **Purpose** — What is being named? What does it do?
2. **Audience** — Who will use/encounter this name?
3. **Tone** — What emotional register? (Serious, playful, technical, warm)
4. **Constraints** — Length limits, required sounds, forbidden associations
5. **Context** — Where will the name appear? What's around it?

### Phase 2: Pattern Definition

Define the naming system:

1. **Sound palette** — Which phonemes to favor/avoid
2. **Syllable templates** — Allowed syllable structures
3. **Meaning direction** — Descriptive, metaphorical, abstract, etc.
4. **Cultural register** — What conventions to follow/break

### Phase 3: Generation

Generate candidates systematically:

1. **Sound-first** — Start with sound patterns, find meanings
2. **Meaning-first** — Start with concepts, find sounds
3. **Reference-first** — Start with cultural touchstones, adapt
4. **Combination** — Blend words, roots, morphemes

**Generate quantity:** 50-100 raw candidates before filtering.

### Phase 4: Evaluation

Filter candidates through layers:

| Layer | Pass Criterion |
|-------|----------------|
| Sound | Pronounceable, appropriate feel, memorable |
| Meaning | Clear enough, positive associations, layered |
| Cultural | No negative associations, appropriate register |
| Functional | Spellable, typeable, available (if required) |

### Phase 5: Validation

For finalists:

1. **Audience testing** — Do target users respond appropriately?
2. **Competitive check** — Distinct from alternatives?
3. **Legal check** — Trademark availability
4. **Technical check** — Domain, social handles, etc.
5. **International check** — No negative meanings in key markets

---

## Professional Naming Process (Sequential)

For software products, companies, and brands, the naming process works **significantly better when phases are separated**. Do not combine phases—complete each fully before moving to the next.

### Why Sequential Matters

When phases are mixed:
- Pattern discovery is constrained by premature evaluation
- Synthesis is rushed before patterns are fully explored
- Evaluation criteria aren't established before judging begins
- Results are mediocre—names that "work" but don't resonate

When phases are separated:
- Discovery explores freely without judgment
- Synthesis builds on complete pattern understanding
- Evaluation applies consistent criteria
- Results are names that feel inevitable

**Rule:** Complete each phase. Document the output. Only then proceed.

---

### Phase 1: Pattern Discovery

**Goal:** Explore the naming space without generating names yet.

**Duration:** Separate session. Don't rush.

**Process:**

1. **Base Pattern Exploration**
   - Core concepts and values of what's being named
   - Key activities and actions it performs
   - Target audience characteristics
   - Emotional resonance desired
   - Industry terminology and conventions
   - Related metaphors and analogies
   - Sensory associations
   - Cultural reference points

2. **Sound-Structure Exploration**
   - Sound-meaning connections relevant to this project
   - Structural patterns that might work (length, syllables)
   - Cultural-linguistic resonance for target audience
   - Formation principles (what makes names in this space work)

3. **Cultural-Linguistic Mapping**
   - Group-specific language patterns
   - Industry expressions and jargon
   - Identity markers for target audience
   - Shared experiences to reference

4. **Multi-Layer Meaning Exploration**
   - Visual-verbal bridge opportunities
   - Multiple interpretation possibilities
   - Reference integration options

**Output:** Pattern documentation. No names yet—just the landscape.

**Completion Check:**
- [ ] Base patterns documented
- [ ] Sound-structure patterns identified
- [ ] Cultural context mapped
- [ ] Meaning layer opportunities noted
- [ ] Ready for synthesis (not before)

---

### Phase 2: Pattern Synthesis

**Goal:** Generate name candidates by combining discovered patterns.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 1 complete and documented.

**Process:**

1. **Level-Based Exploration**

   Work through distinct levels, tracking evolution:

   | Level | Focus | Examples |
   |-------|-------|----------|
   | **Meta** | Vision, purpose, identity | What this represents at highest level |
   | **Macro** | Domain, category, positioning | Where it sits in the landscape |
   | **Core** | Function, activity, interaction | What it actually does |
   | **Micro** | Expression, implementation | Specific word choices |

2. **Sound-Structure Synthesis**
   - Combine sound patterns with meaning
   - Test rhythm and flow
   - Check pronunciation across contexts
   - Verify cultural fit

3. **Layer Integration**
   - Build meaning layers into candidates
   - Test multiple readings
   - Assess accessibility at different levels

4. **Candidate Generation**
   - Sound-first approach (patterns → meanings)
   - Meaning-first approach (concepts → sounds)
   - Reference-first approach (touchstones → adaptations)
   - Combination approach (blends, portmanteaus)

**Output:** 50-100 raw candidates with notes on pattern origins.

**Completion Check:**
- [ ] All levels explored
- [ ] Multiple synthesis approaches used
- [ ] Candidates documented with pattern rationale
- [ ] Quantity sufficient for meaningful filtering
- [ ] Ready for evaluation (not before)

---

### Phase 3: Pattern Evaluation

**Goal:** Filter candidates through systematic criteria.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 2 complete. Candidates exist.

**Process:**

1. **Evidence Classification**

   Separate what you can verify internally from what requires external checking:

   **Internally Verifiable:**
   - Pattern alignment with project goals
   - Linguistic analysis (structure, pronunciation)
   - Meaning analysis (layers, resonance)
   - Cultural-linguistic effectiveness

   **Externally Verifiable (Phase 5):**
   - Domain availability
   - Trademark status
   - Social handle availability
   - Market conflicts

2. **Layer-by-Layer Evaluation**

   | Layer | Criteria | Pass/Fail |
   |-------|----------|-----------|
   | Sound | Pronounceable, appropriate feel, memorable | |
   | Meaning | Clear, positive associations, layered | |
   | Cultural | No negative associations, right register | |
   | Functional | Spellable, typeable, searchable | |

3. **Pattern Strength Assessment**
   - How well does candidate express discovered patterns?
   - Is the pattern-to-name translation clear?
   - Does it feel inevitable or forced?

4. **Ranking Development**
   - Tier 1: Strong across all layers
   - Tier 2: Strong in most, fixable weaknesses
   - Tier 3: Interesting but significant issues
   - Cut: Fatal flaws

**Output:** Ranked shortlist with documented rationale.

**Completion Check:**
- [ ] All candidates evaluated against layers
- [ ] Internal verification complete
- [ ] Rankings established with reasoning
- [ ] External verification needs documented
- [ ] Ready for validation (not before)

---

### Phase 4: Validation

**Process:**

1. **Technical Validation**
   - Domain availability (see [domain-naming.md](domain-naming.md))
   - Social handle availability
   - App store name availability (if relevant)

2. **Legal Validation**
   - Trademark search
   - Business name registration check
   - Existing brand conflicts

3. **Market Validation**
   - Similar names in use
   - Competitor analysis
   - Industry pattern fit

4. **Audience Validation**
   - Target user response testing
   - First impression testing
   - Pronunciation testing
   - Recall testing

5. **International Validation** (if relevant)
   - Meaning in other languages

   - Cultural associations in key markets

**Output:** Validated finalist(s) with complete assessment.

**Completion Check:**
- [ ] Technical availability confirmed
- [ ] Legal risks assessed
- [ ] Market positioning validated
- [ ] Audience response tested
- [ ] International issues checked
- [ ] Ready for decision

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Handoff

**Goal:** Document the decision and rationale for future reference.

**Process:**

1. **Decision Narrative**
   - Why this name emerged from the process
   - Key pattern connections
   - How it expresses project values
   - What makes it work

2. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Pronunciation guide
   - Usage guidelines
   - Variant handling (nicknames, abbreviations)
   - What to avoid

3. **Asset Documentation**
   - Secured domains
   - Registered handles
   - Trademark status
   - Style guidance

**Output:** Complete naming documentation package.

## Application: Brand Names

### Sound Patterns for Brand Attributes

| Attribute | Sound Approach |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Trustworthy** | Common phonemes, simple syllables, familiar patterns |
| **Innovative** | Unusual combinations, invented words, tech sounds |
| **Luxurious** | French/Italian sounds, flowing patterns, soft consonants |
| **Powerful** | Hard consonants, short syllables, strong stops |
| **Friendly** | Open vowels, soft consonants, nickname-able |

### Naming Conventions by Sector

Documented in [domain-naming.md](domain-naming.md) for:
- Technology
- Consumer products
- Financial services
- Healthcare
- Professional services

---

## Application: Character Names

### Consistency Within Culture

Characters from the same culture should share:
- **Phoneme inventory** — Same sounds appear
- **Syllable patterns** — Similar structures
- **Naming conventions** — Patronymics, honorifics, etc.

**Use the conlang skill** for systematic character naming when building fictional cultures.

### Character-Sound Alignment

Match sounds to character attributes:
- Heroic names often have strong consonants, open vowels
- Villainous names may have harsh sounds, unusual clusters
- Gentle characters benefit from soft consonants, flowing patterns

**Subversion:** Breaking these patterns can create interesting dissonance (soft-named villain, harsh-named hero).

---

## Application: Fiction Titles

See [fiction-titles.md](Synthea%20Fiction%20Title%20Framework.md) for:
- Genre-specific title patterns
- Sound-emotion integration
- Symbolic layering techniques

---

## Anti-Patterns

### The Kitchen Sink
**Pattern:** Trying to communicate everything in one name.
**Problem:** Overcomplicated, hard to remember, no clear signal.
**Fix:** Pick one primary message; let other layers be subtle.

### The Inside Joke
**Pattern:** Name meaningful only to creators.
**Problem:** Audience doesn't get it; seems random.
**Fix:** Test with naive users; meaning should be discoverable.

### The Sound-Alike
**Pattern:** Too similar to existing name in category.
**Problem:** Confusion, legal issues, no differentiation.
**Fix:** Check competitors thoroughly; verify distinctiveness.

### The Forced Meaning
**Pattern:** Name that "means" something only via tortured explanation.
**Problem:** No one gets it without the explanation.
**Fix:** If meaning requires explanation, it doesn't work as meaning.

### The Unpronounceable
**Pattern:** Looks interesting but no one can say it.
**Problem:** Word of mouth dies; people avoid saying it.
**Fix:** Test pronunciation with naive readers; simplify clusters.

### The Apostrophe Catastrophe
**Pattern:** Apostrophes used for exotic feel with no linguistic logic.
**Problem:** Inconsistent, confusing, hard to type/search.
**Fix:** If using apostrophes, define what they mean; use sparingly.
