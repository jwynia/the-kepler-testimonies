# The Kepler Testimonies

An experimental collaborative fiction project. The AI team (Claude Opus + custom fiction skills/frameworks) does the heavy lifting of drafting. Humans act as producers/directors, voting on key decisions.

## Origin

This started as a [Threads post](https://www.threads.com/@jwynia/post/DS8sAi1jTX3) asking if anyone would participate in a public AI fiction experiment. The answer was yes.

The first vote chose the premise from three AI-generated pitches:

- **THE LAST ORIGINAL** — Your backed-up husband came back better. Now you can't tell if he's still him.
- **THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES** — 500 testimonies from a vanished ship. 488 are ordinary. 12 are impossible. All are true. ✓ *Winner*
- **TRANSLATION DISTANCE** — Every conversation with the alien is an invasion of privacy. Understanding might be worth it.

"The Kepler Testimonies" was the winner and this repo was created with that name as a result.

## How This Works

All AI session logs, drafts, and decisions live in this repo. The full history of how the story develops—including dead ends and revisions—will be visible.
