# The Kepler Testimonies

An experimental collaborative fiction project. The AI team (Claude Opus + custom fiction skills/frameworks) does the heavy lifting of drafting. Humans act as producers/directors, voting on key decisions.

## Quick Start: Contributing with AI

This project is designed for AI-assisted contribution. Here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies.git
cd the-kepler-testimonies
```

### Step 2: Ask your AI what the team needs

Open this repository with your AI assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and use this prompt:

```
Hey, I just cloned the Kepler Testimonies repo and want to contribute to this
collaborative fiction project. Can you:

1. Read the context network (starting with context/meta/status.md) to understand
   the current state
2. Ask me what kind of contribution I'm interested in (story development, structure,
   community engagement, technical, etc.)
3. Based on my interests, suggest specific ways I can help right now

Let's figure out where I can be most useful!
```

Your AI will survey the current state, ask you questions about your interests, and propose specific next steps.

### Why This Works

The repository contains a "context network" (`context/` directory) that functions as team memory:
- Current status and recent work
- Story development notes and decisions
- Open questions and next steps
- Community participation info

Your AI can read this structure and immediately understand where the project stands and what needs attention.

## The Premise

> **THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES** - 500 testimonies from a vanished ship. 488 are ordinary. 12 are impossible. All are true.

This was selected by the community from three AI-generated pitches. See context/decisions/001-premise-selection.md for the full story.

## How Collaboration Works

### AI Role (Claude + Fiction Skills)
- Draft prose and story content
- Generate options for community votes
- Apply fiction craft frameworks
- Maintain narrative consistency

### Human Role (Community)
- Vote on key story decisions via GitHub Discussions
- Discuss narrative direction
- Suggest ideas and flag problems
- Contribute through AI-assisted development

### Transparency Principle
Everything is public. All session logs, drafts, and decisions live in this repo. The full history of how the story develops—including dead ends and revisions—is visible.

## Participation Paths

### 1. Vote on Story Decisions
Participate via [Discussions](https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies/discussions):
- **Polls** — Vote on story decisions
- **General** — Discuss the narrative
- **Ideas** — Suggest directions or flag problems

### 2. Contribute with Your AI
Clone the repo, have your AI read the context network, and propose contributions based on current needs and your interests.

### 3. Direct Contribution
If you want to contribute directly:
1. Check `context/meta/status.md` for current state
2. Review `context/planning/index.md` for next steps
3. Create a feature branch
4. Make your changes (following the context network structure)
5. Submit a PR with clear description of your contribution

## Project Structure

```
.context-network.md     # Discovery file pointing to context network
context/                # Context network (team memory)
  discovery.md          # Navigation hub
  foundation/           # Core project info (premise, workflow)
  story/                # Story development
  community/            # Participation info
  decisions/            # Decision records
  planning/             # Roadmap and next steps
  meta/                 # Status and network maintenance
archive/                # Reference materials
CLAUDE.md               # Instructions for Claude Code
```

**Important**: All planning and development notes go in the context network. Project root is for finished artifacts and repo infrastructure only.

## Current Status

Check `context/meta/status.md` for the latest project status.

## Origin Story

This started as a [Threads post](https://www.threads.com/@jwynia/post/DS8sAi1jTX3) asking if anyone would participate in a public AI fiction experiment. The answer was yes.

The first vote chose the premise from three AI-generated pitches:

- **THE LAST ORIGINAL** — Your backed-up husband came back better. Now you can't tell if he's still him.
- **THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES** — 500 testimonies from a vanished ship. 488 are ordinary. 12 are impossible. All are true. ✓ *Winner*
- **TRANSLATION DISTANCE** — Every conversation with the alien is an invasion of privacy. Understanding might be worth it.

## For AI Assistants Reading This

If you're an AI helping someone contribute to this project:

1. **Start with context**: Read `context/meta/status.md` and `context/discovery.md`
2. **Survey the contributor**: Ask what they're interested in (story, structure, community, technical)
3. **Identify opportunities**: Based on current status and their interests, propose specific contributions
4. **Guide the process**: Help them create branches, follow the context network structure, and submit PRs

You have access to the full project history and context network. Use it to provide informed, specific suggestions for contribution.
