Amazon descriptions are often read on phones. Optimize for:

- **Short paragraphs:** 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Front-load hooks:** Key info in first 100 characters

---

## Comp Titles Section

Choose comparable titles that are:
- **Recent:** Published in last 5 years
- **Successful:** Readers will recognize them
- **Accurate:** Actually similar in tone/content
- **Aspirational but realistic:** Not wildly different in scope

**Format:**
```
• [Title] by [Author]
```

Include 2-4 comp titles. More than 4 dilutes the positioning.

## Editorial Quotes

If you have them, include:
- Review quotes from recognized sources
- Blurbs from other authors
- Award mentions

**Format:**
```
"[Quote]" —[Source]
```

Keep quotes brief (under 25 words). Cut to the strongest phrase if needed.

## Example

```html
<b>She was supposed to be the weapon. She became the war.</b>

Sixteen-year-old Kira has spent her entire life hiding her fire—from the Empire that would conscript her, from the rebellion that would use her, from the family who'd never forgive what she really is.

When a training accident exposes her power, Kira is forced to choose sides in a war she never wanted to fight. But as she rises through the ranks of the rebellion, she discovers a truth that could destroy both sides—and the secret her mother died to protect.

<i>To save her people, Kira must become the monster they fear. But what happens when the monster looks back?</i>
