# Plan: Brainstorm Next Step Voting Options

## Goal
Generate 3 distinct options each for two foundational questions, to present as a combined community vote:
1. **What is the Kepler?** (ship type, mission, era)
2. **What makes 12 testimonies "impossible" yet true?**

## Approach

### Step 1: Use `/brainstorming` skill
Invoke the brainstorming skill to break out of convergent/default ideas. Science fiction has many tropes (generation ships, AI gone wrong, time loops) - we need fresh angles.

**For "What is the Kepler?"**
- Generate options that span different genres, eras, and stakes
- Each option should suggest different types of testimonies
- Avoid clustering around a single trope

**For "The Impossible Mechanism"**
- Generate options for HOW contradictory testimonies can all be "true"
- Consider: physics-breaking, perception-breaking, reality-breaking, narrative-breaking
- Each mechanism should create different storytelling possibilities

### Step 2: Draft options for community vote
Format each option with:
- Short memorable name
- 2-3 sentence description
- What kind of story it enables

### Step 3: Document in context network
- Add options to `context/story/` for the vote
- Update `context/meta/status.md`
- Create discussion post format for GitHub

## Output
Two sets of 3 options, ready for community voting via GitHub Discussions.

## Files to Modify
- `context/story/concept-options.md` (new - voting options)
- `context/meta/status.md` (update with current activity)
