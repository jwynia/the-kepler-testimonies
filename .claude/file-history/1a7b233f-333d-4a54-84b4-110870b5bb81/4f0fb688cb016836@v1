## Separation of Concerns

Craft files describe **how to write** the story, not what happens (that's [[../outline/_index|Outline]]) or who's involved (that's [[../elements/_index|Elements]]).

Examples:
- "Testimonies use first person past tense" → Craft
- "The Kepler was a research vessel" → Elements/Places
- "Testimony 47 reveals the captain's secret" → Outline
