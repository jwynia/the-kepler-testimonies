# Issues

Individual issue files for story problems identified during development.

## Contents

*No issues created yet.*

Issues are created when diagnostic skills (like `/story-sense`, `/character-arc`, `/genre-conventions`) identify problems, or when manual review finds gaps.

## Issue Lifecycle

1. **Create**: Get next ID from [[../backlog|backlog]], create file, increment counter, add to backlog table
2. **Work**: Change status to "In Progress", implement fix
3. **Resolve**: Update affected files, change status to "Resolved (YYYY-MM-DD)", move to Resolved table in backlog
