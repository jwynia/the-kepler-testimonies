# Workflow: AI + Human Collaboration

## The Division of Labor

### AI Team (Claude Opus + Fiction Skills)
- Drafts prose and story content
- Generates options for community votes
- Applies fiction craft frameworks
- Maintains consistency across the narrative

### Human Directors (Community)
- Vote on key story decisions
- Discuss narrative direction
- Suggest ideas and flag problems
- Act as producers guiding the vision

## Transparency Principle
Everything happens in public:
- All AI session logs are committed to the repo
- Drafts are visible, including dead ends
- Revisions and their reasoning are documented
- The full history of how the story develops is preserved

## Participation Channels

All participation happens via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies/discussions):

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Polls** | Vote on story decisions |
| **General** | Discuss the narrative |
| **Ideas** | Suggest directions or flag problems |

## Decision Flow
1. AI generates options or drafts
2. Options presented to community (if decision point)
3. Community votes/discusses
4. Winning direction is implemented
5. Decision recorded in context network
