# Plan: Incorporate Outline Structure Guide into Context Network

## Goal
Adapt the outline structure system from `inbox/outline-structure-guide.md` into this project's context network, modified for the testimony format rather than traditional novel chapters.

## Key Principles to Adopt

From the guide:
1. **Atomic documents** - One concept per file, heavily cross-linked
2. **Navigation everywhere** - Every folder has an `_index.md` hub
3. **Multiple granularities** - Tagline → Premise → Synopsis → Outline → Draft
4. **Clear separation** - Structure, elements, craft decisions, and prose live apart
5. **Backlog system** - Issue tracking for story problems with prioritized categories
6. **Status everywhere** - Everything has a clear state

## Adaptation Required

The guide assumes traditional novel chapters. This project has:
- 500 testimonies (488 ordinary, 12 impossible)
- Epistolary/testimony format
- Community-directed development

This requires structural adaptation while preserving the organizational principles.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Update `context/story/` Structure

Transform `context/story/` to follow the guide's separation:

```
context/story/
├── index.md                    # Navigation hub (already exists, update)
├── meta/                       # Story-level summaries
│   ├── tagline.md             # One line (move from foundation?)
│   ├── premise.md             # One paragraph (already exists in foundation)
│   └── synopsis.md            # One page overview
├── outline/
│   ├── _index.md              # Structure overview
│   ├── backlog.md             # Issue tracker
│   ├── structure.md           # How 500 testimonies are organized
│   ├── arcs/                  # Narrative arcs across testimonies
│   │   └── _index.md
│   ├── testimonies/           # Testimony outlines (analogous to chapters/)
│   │   ├── _index.md          # Testimony roster
│   │   ├── the-twelve/        # The 12 impossible testimonies
│   │   │   └── _index.md
│   │   └── ordinary/          # The 488 ordinary testimonies
│   │       └── _index.md
│   └── issues/
│       └── _index.md
├── elements/
│   ├── _index.md
│   ├── characters/
│   │   └── _index.md
│   ├── places/
│   │   └── _index.md
│   ├── organizations/
│   │   └── _index.md
│   └── objects/
│       └── _index.md
└── craft/
    ├── _index.md
    ├── voice.md               # Testimony voice decisions
    └── decisions.md           # Writing choices
```

### 2. Add Drafts Location (Outside Context Network)

Per project rules, finished artifacts go outside context network:

```
testimonies/                    # Published testimony texts
├── the-twelve/
└── ordinary/
```

### 3. Create New Index Files

Add `_index.md` navigation files to all folders that contain multiple items.

### 4. Update Discovery/Navigation

Update `context/discovery.md` to reflect new structure.

### 5. Document the System

Create `context/foundation/outline-workflow.md` explaining:
- How this system works
- Backlog priority levels
- Issue lifecycle
- Drafting workflow adapted for testimonies

## Questions to Clarify

1. **Meta location:** Should `tagline.md` and `premise.md` stay in `foundation/` or move to `story/meta/`? (Guide puts them under novel-specific meta/)

2. **Testimony organization:** The 500 testimonies need a grouping strategy. Options:
   - By narrator type (crew, passengers, observers)
   - By timeline (before, during, after the event)
   - By theme/thread
   - Simply numbered with metadata

3. **Immediate scope:** Should I set up the full structure now (while voting is active), or just document the system and create structure incrementally as needed?

## Files to Create/Modify

### Create New Files
- `context/story/meta/tagline.md`
- `context/story/meta/synopsis.md`
- `context/story/outline/_index.md`
- `context/story/outline/backlog.md`
- `context/story/outline/issues/_index.md`
- `context/story/outline/testimonies/_index.md`
- `context/story/elements/_index.md`
- `context/story/elements/characters/_index.md`
- `context/story/elements/places/_index.md`
- `context/story/craft/_index.md`
- `context/story/craft/voice.md`
- `context/foundation/outline-workflow.md`

### Modify Existing Files
- `context/story/index.md` - Update to reflect new structure
- `context/discovery.md` - Add navigation to new areas
- `context/meta/status.md` - Document structural changes

### Archive
- `inbox/outline-structure-guide.md` → Move to `archive/` after incorporation
