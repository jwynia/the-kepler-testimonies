## Construction Process

### Step 1: Identify the Core

What is the ONE thing that makes this book different?
- Unique premise element?
- Emotional promise?
- Central conflict?
- Character contradiction?

### Step 2: Choose Your Type

Based on genre and core:
| Genre | Best Tagline Types |
|-------|-------------------|
| Romance | Promise, Question |
| Thriller | Question, Statement |
| Fantasy | Contrast, Comparison |
| Mystery | Question, Statement |
| Horror | Statement, Question |
| Literary | Promise, Contrast |

### Step 3: Draft Multiple Versions

Generate 5-10 variants. Don't judge yet.

### Step 4: Sound Test

Read each aloud:
- Does it have rhythm?
- Are there hard consonants for impact or soft sounds for emotion?
- Is it memorable after one hearing?

### Step 5: Cut Ruthlessly

Remove:
- Filler words (very, really, just)
- Unnecessary articles (a, the, an)
- Weak verbs (is, was, has)
- Generic adjectives (amazing, incredible, epic)

## Sound Principles

From the naming skill—apply to taglines:

### Rhythm
- Odd-numbered syllables often feel more memorable
- Parallel structure creates punch ("She hunts monsters. She is one.")
- End on strong syllable when possible

### Consonants
- Hard sounds (k, t, p) = impact, strength
- Soft sounds (s, l, m) = mystery, emotion
- Match sound to content

### Alliteration
- Use sparingly
- Can create memorability
- Can also feel cheesy—test carefully

## Examples by Genre

### Romance
- "Some love stories end. This one begins."
- "What happens when your worst enemy becomes your only hope?"
- "A second chance she never asked for."

### Thriller
- "72 hours. One suspect. And she's running out of time."
- "The closer she gets to the truth, the more she wishes she'd stopped looking."
- "Trust no one. Especially yourself."

### Fantasy
- "Magic has a price. She's already paid it."
- "The crown chooses. The gods demand. The girl refuses."
- "Three kingdoms. One heir. Zero mercy."

### Mystery
- "Everyone in this town has a secret. One of them is deadly."
- "She knows who killed her. She just can't prove it."
- "The truth is buried. She's ready to dig."

### Horror
- "Some houses remember. This one hungers."
- "They followed her home. They're still here."
