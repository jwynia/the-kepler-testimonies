# Story Meta

Story-level summaries at increasing levels of detail.

## Contents

| File | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| [[tagline]] | One line | Elevator pitch |
| [[premise]] | One paragraph | Story hook and core concept |
| [[synopsis]] | One page | Full arc overview |

## Usage

These files represent the same story at different zoom levels. Each should stand alone - you should be able to understand the story from any level without needing the others.

When story development progresses, update these files to reflect the current understanding. The tagline and premise are relatively stable; the synopsis evolves with outline development.
