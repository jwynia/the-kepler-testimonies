# Story Development

Central hub for all story development work on The Kepler Testimonies.

## Current State

**Status**: Foundation established — Ready for outline development

### Locked Decisions
| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| **Vessel Type** | The Stopover (deep-space waystation) |
| **Impossibility Type** | The Agreement Problem (mundane details that can't all be true) |
| **Structure** | Investigation-driven narrative |
| **Investigator Arc** | Bureaucratic assignment → personal connection → evidence won't fit → institutional pressure |

See [Decision 003](../decisions/003-foundation-choices.md) for full rationale.

### Open Questions
- Who is the investigator? (role, agency, disposition)
- What's the personal connection to someone aboard?
- What institution is pushing for a cover story?
- What's the ending?

See [[../planning/index|Planning]] for next steps.
