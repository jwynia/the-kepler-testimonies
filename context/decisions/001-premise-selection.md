# Decision 001: Premise Selection

## Summary
The community selected THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES as the story premise from three AI-generated options.

## Context
The project began with a [Threads post](https://www.threads.com/@jwynia/post/DS8sAi1jTX3) asking if anyone would participate in a public AI fiction experiment. After confirming interest, the first vote was held to choose the premise.

## Options Presented

### Option A: THE LAST ORIGINAL
> Your backed-up husband came back better. Now you can't tell if he's still him.

A personal, intimate sci-fi exploring identity and consciousness through the lens of backup/restoration technology.

### Option B: THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES
> 500 testimonies from a vanished ship. 488 are ordinary. 12 are impossible. All are true.

A mystery structured through collected testimonies, playing with truth and the limits of perception.

### Option C: TRANSLATION DISTANCE
> Every conversation with the alien is an invasion of privacy. Understanding might be worth it.

First contact story exploring communication, consent, and the cost of understanding across species.

## Decision
**THE KEPLER TESTIMONIES** was selected by community vote.

## Rationale
The community vote determined the outcome. Specific reasons cited in discussion included:
- Intriguing structure (testimony format)
- Built-in mystery (12 impossible, all true)
- Flexibility for episodic development

## Implications
- Story will be structured around collected testimonies
- Mystery/revelation arc is central
- Need to develop what "impossible but true" means
- Kepler (likely a ship) and its vanishing are the core mystery

## Status
**Implemented** - This is the locked premise for the project.
