# Community Participation

## Overview
The Kepler Testimonies is a community-directed project. Humans act as producers and directors, voting on key decisions while AI handles the drafting work.

## How to Participate

All participation happens via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jwynia/the-kepler-testimonies/discussions):

### Polls
Vote on story decisions. When the AI team generates options for a narrative choice, polls determine which direction to take.

**Voting format:** Every poll includes:
- Generated options (typically 3)
- **"None of these"** — with space to suggest a better approach

This prevents forcing choices nobody loves and opens space for community ideas the AI didn't generate. If "none of these" wins or gets significant support, we run another brainstorm round.

### General
Discuss the narrative, characters, themes, or any aspect of the story. This is the main conversation space.

### Ideas
Suggest directions, propose elements to include, or flag problems you've noticed. The AI team reviews these for consideration.

## Participation Guidelines
- All voices welcome
- Constructive feedback encouraged
- Trust the process - not every suggestion can be incorporated
- The goal is collaborative storytelling, not consensus

## Decision History
