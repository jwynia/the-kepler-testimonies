# Back-of-Book Blurb Template

**Purpose:** Physical book browsers, library patrons
**Length:** 150-200 words

## Structure

### Hook Paragraph (25-50 words)

```
[CHARACTER] has [SITUATION/PROBLEM] [INTRIGUING DETAIL THAT CREATES QUESTION].
```

The first sentence must stop browsers. Name the protagonist. Ground them in a specific, interesting situation. Include one detail that makes readers curious.

**Examples:**
- "Kira has spent sixteen years hiding her fire—from the authorities who'd execute her, from the family who'd disown her, even from herself."
- "When Detective Maya Chen finds her own fingerprints at a murder scene she doesn't remember visiting, she has 72 hours to solve the case—or become its next victim."

---

### Setup Paragraph (50-75 words)

```
[WHAT THEY WANT].
[WHAT'S STOPPING THEM].
[WHAT COMPLICATES THINGS].
```

Expand the conflict. Show what's at stake. Introduce complications without spoiling past the first act.

---

### Stakes Question (25-50 words)

```
[WHAT THEY RISK LOSING]. [QUESTION OR TENSION THAT DEMANDS RESOLUTION].
```

End with tension, never resolution. Leave readers needing to know what happens.

**Examples:**
- "With her family's lives hanging in the balance, Kira must choose: embrace the power that could destroy everything she loves—or let the darkness consume them all."
- "To save her city, Maya must trust the one person who wants her dead. But can she trust herself?"
