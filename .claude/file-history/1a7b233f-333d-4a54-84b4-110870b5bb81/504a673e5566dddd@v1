# Voice

POV, voice, and testimony style decisions.

## Status

*Not yet developed.*

Voice decisions will be made as we begin drafting testimonies.

## Questions to Decide

### Testimony Format
- How are testimonies formatted? (Q&A? Narrative? Mixed?)
- Is there a consistent frame? (Deposition? Interview? Written statement?)
- What metadata accompanies each testimony?

### Voice Consistency
- How do we differentiate 500 voices?
- What makes the 12 impossible testimonies sound different (or the same)?
- How do we balance variety with coherence?

### POV and Tense
- First person past? First person present?
- Are all testimonies the same tense, or does it vary?
- Is there a frame narrator or just raw testimonies?
