# Query Letter Pitch Template

**Purpose:** Agent/publisher submission
**Length:** 150-200 words (pitch paragraph only, not full query letter)

---

## Structure

### Hook (1-2 sentences)

```
[Core conflict + what makes this book unique]
```

The hook must earn the read. It should make an agent think "I haven't seen this before" or "I need to know more."

**Examples:**
- "When forensic accountant Maya Chen finds her own fingerprints at a murder scene she doesn't remember visiting, she has 72 hours to solve the case before she becomes its next suspect."
- "Sixteen-year-old Kira has one rule: never let them see you burn. In a world where fire-wielders are conscripted as weapons, discovery means death—or worse, service."

---

### Setup (50-75 words)

```
[PROTAGONIST NAME] is a [ESSENTIAL IDENTITY] who [SITUATION].
[What they want.]
[What's stopping them.]
```

Ground the protagonist quickly. Essential identity = the role/trait most relevant to the story. Situation = where they are when the story opens.

**Example:**
"Kira has survived sixteen years by hiding in plain sight, suppressing the fire that burns in her blood. But when a training accident exposes her power, she's forced into the Emperor's elite corps of fire-wielders—soldiers who are more weapon than human. To survive, she must master abilities she's spent her life denying. To escape, she'll have to burn her way out."

---

### Stakes (50-75 words)

```
[What escalates.]
[What they'll lose if they fail.]
[The impossible choice they face.]
```

Show the pressure. Make clear what's at risk—personally, not just plot-wise. End on the choice or tension, not the outcome.

**Example:**
"When Kira discovers the Emperor's fire-wielders are being used to commit atrocities in the outer provinces—including the destruction of her home village—she must choose: stay hidden and survive, or expose the truth and become the rebellion's most wanted weapon. Either way, someone she loves will die."

---

### Meta Line (1 sentence)

```
[TITLE] is a [WORD COUNT] [GENRE] novel, perfect for fans of [COMP 1] and [COMP 2].
```

**Example:**
"BURN BRIGHT is a 95,000-word YA fantasy, perfect for fans of An Ember in the Ashes and Red Queen."

## Comp Title Guidelines

### Choose titles that are:
- **Recent:** Published in last 5 years (ideally 3)
- **Successful:** Agents recognize them
- **Accurate:** Actually similar in tone, style, or concept
- **Same category:** YA comps for YA, adult for adult
- **Not mega-bestsellers:** Harry Potter and Twilight are too big to comp

### Format options:
- "[Title] meets [Title]" — classic mashup
- "Perfect for fans of [Title] and [Title]" — reader-focused
- "[Title] with [twist]" — single comp plus differentiator

### Good comp combinations:
- Same genre, different angle (plot comp + voice comp)
- Recent hit + established favorite
- One for tone, one for concept

## Agent Expectations

Agents read hundreds of queries. They're looking for:

1. **Voice** — Does the pitch show the book's voice?
2. **Clarity** — Can they understand the story in one read?
3. **Stakes** — Do they care what happens?
4. **Category fit** — Does it match what they represent?
5. **Professionalism** — Is it polished and appropriate length?

What agents don't want:
- Rhetorical questions as hooks
- "In a world where..." openings
- Vague stakes ("everything will change")
- Comparing yourself to mega-authors
- Synopsis of entire plot
