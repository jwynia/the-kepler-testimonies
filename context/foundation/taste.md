# Creative Taste

This document captures the individual creative preferences of people working on The Kepler Testimonies. It's how we establish productive creative friction and make implicit assumptions explicit.

## Purpose & Philosophy

Different people have different tastes. One person loves *Avatar*, another hates it. One writer loves grimdark, another won't touch it. That's fine—better than fine, actually. Diverse preferences create better stories.

**This document's job**: Make those preferences explicit so they inform creative decisions.

**Why this matters**:
- Implicit assumptions lead to vague directives ("make it compelling") that produce bland results
- Explicit preferences let AI and humans understand *why* decisions matter
- Friction between different tastes generates more interesting options
- The goal is not consensus but productive creative tension

**How we use this**:
- When making story decisions, we reference these preferences
- Conflicting preferences go to community votes (where they should be aired)
- AI uses these to generate diverse voting options
- Forced tradeoffs emerge from decisions made ("We chose competence, not cynicism")

## How This Works

### For Contributors

When you join this project, add your taste entry to this document. What you love, what you hate, what matters to you creatively. Be specific. "Good characters" means nothing. "Characters who speak in distinct voices and have non-aligned motivations" is actionable.

Your entry doesn't need to match anyone else's. Disagreement is the point.

### For AI Contributors

Read all the taste entries. When they align, great—that's guidance. When they conflict, that's also guidance. Generate voting options that reflect the range of preferences. If you can't honor someone's stated preference, explain why in the decision record.

Pay special attention to forced tradeoffs ("We do X, not Y"). Those are project-level commitments that override individual preference.

### For Decision Framework

- **Tier 1 (AI Autonomous)** work should respect these preferences in execution
- **Tier 2 (Community Vote)** options should reflect this range of taste
- **Tier 3 (Director Decision)** should document which tastes influenced the choice

## Individual Taste Entries

### jwynia (Project Director)

**Authors/Works I Love**:
- Robert Heinlein: *Stranger in a Strange Land*, *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* - Ideas matter, characters grapple with them
- Douglas Adams: Wit and absurdity grounded in character voice
- *The Expanse*: Plot moves forward crisply, characters are competent
- *The Martian*: Problem-solving as character, grounded worldbuilding, wit without undercutting stakes

**What I Want More Of**:
- Actual machinations of power—how institutions really work, not cynical caricatures
- Competent people facing real constraints
- Wit as character voice, not narrator commentary
- Grounded worldbuilding that serves story, not the reverse

**What I Want Less Of**:
- Naval-gazey sci-fi that disappears up its own philosophy
- Complexity mistaken for depth (the more baroque, the smarter it thinks it is)
- Lengthy exposition pretending to be worldbuilding
- Cynicism as cleverness

**BIGGEST PET PEEVE** (cannot stress this enough):
Clean good vs. evil where every corporation is corrupt, every government is dumb, and some lone hero hacker is the only one who can see through the bullshit. I HATE this. Show me actual people in actual institutions. Politicians can be competent AND wrong. Corporations have genuine internal conflicts. Government can work AND still fail people. Show me how power actually flows, not cartoon versions of it.

**For This Project**:
- Testimonies should feel like they come from real people with real lives
- Impossibility should be earned, not arbitrary
- If there's conspiracy, show me how it actually works—what incentives, what information, what constraints
- Competence matters more than cynicism

## Forced Tradeoffs

These are explicit creative directions that emerge from decisions. They're "We do X, not Y" statements that guide all work.

These will be populated as community votes conclude and Director decisions are made. For now, this section is empty.

**How this works**: When a community vote or Director decision establishes creative direction, we capture it here as a tradeoff. Example: "We do competence-driven problem-solving, not grimdark survival horror."

This prevents vague directives and keeps everyone aligned on what we chose and what we *didn't* choose.

## Using This Document

### When Making Creative Decisions

1. Read the taste entries relevant to your decision
2. If preferences align, that's your guidance
3. If preferences conflict, let the conflict inform your voting options (show all sides)
4. Document which tastes influenced your choice in decision records

### When Drafting

1. Remember the forced tradeoffs—they're non-negotiable
2. Respect individual preferences where possible
3. If you can't honor a preference, explain why in the PR or decision record
4. Bias toward "more interesting" over "safer" when preferences conflict

### When Voting

1. Read the taste entries to understand where perspectives come from
2. Consider whether options honor the range of preferences
3. Flag if something seems to contradict the forced tradeoffs
4. Use community discussion to surface preference conflicts
